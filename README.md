## Next Js CRUD practice with Prisma

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) practice project developed using Next.js 14, App Router, and Prisma. The application allows users to perform all four basic operations on tasks.

Users can view existing tasks, add new ones, edit existing tasks, and remove tasks as needed. This project serves as a practical demonstration of CRUD operations in a full-stack JavaScript environment using Next.js and Prisma.
